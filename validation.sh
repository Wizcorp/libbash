# Takes in a space separated list of command which should be expected. If anyone
# one of the listed commands are found to not exist, an error will thrown for
# that command. And once all commands are processed, if any were found missing
# function will exit with status code of 1 and return those missing command names
# in a predefined array called notFoundCommands.
# 
# Commands can be scripts, system binaries etc. found in $PATH or functions
#
# Usage: EnsureCommandsAvailable command1 [command2] [...]
#
# Arguments:
#     commands: space separated list of commands which to test for
#
# Environment Variables:
#   notFoundCommands: Array list of commands which could not be found.
#
#       SILENT_ERROR: (BOOLEAN) Whether or not an error should be written to
#                     STDERR when a command is not found. This is useful if you
#                     want to display a custom error message, or handle it in a
#                     different fashion.

# Function which takes in a list of arguments and allowed arguments and then
# determines if there are any foreign arguments. If none are found it will then
# store the argument value pairs into variables with argument label and values.
#
# Usage: ParseArguments <allowed> <arguments>
#
# Arguments:
#     allowed: space or comma separated list of allowed arguments. Anything not
#              in this list will be considered foreign and will cause the function
#              to exit with error code 1.
#
#   arguments: list of arguments passed to your application (usually will be $@)
#              which will be tested against allowed values passed. Also these
#              will then be pulled a part and stored into actual variables.
#
# Environment Variables:
#   invalidArguments: Array list of arguments which were invalid.
#
#       SILENT_ERROR: (BOOLEAN) Whether or not an error should be written to
#                     STDERR when a command is not found. This is useful if you
#                     want to display a custom error message, or handle it in a
#                     different fashion.
